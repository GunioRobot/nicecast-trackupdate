This is a simple script which polls iTunes every 10 seconds and writes
information about the current track to Nicecast's "NowPlaying.txt" file.

This script requires 'appscript' be installed, information about appscript
can be found here:

http://appscript.sourceforge.net/py-appscript/index.html

While this script is running, you may notice a persistent bouncing dock icon
for python.  This annoyed me, so I removed it by editing:

/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/Resources/Python.app/Contents/Info.plist

and adding the following key to the <dict> tag:
    <key>NSUIElement</key>
    <string>1</string>
