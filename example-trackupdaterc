# You need to obtain a Consumer Key/Secret here:

OAuthConsumerKey: <key>
OAuthConsumerSecret: <key>

# These two values will be generated for you the first time you run the
# plugin.  You will need to open a url (provided by the plugin) and
# authorize the application WHILE LOGGED IN AS THE TWITTER ACCOUNT YOU WISH
# TO POST TO!  Once you authorize the application you'll receive a PIN which
# you will input into nicecast-trackupdate.  Once you have done all this,
# the following two config values will be written to the screen.  Copy them
# into this file and you'll never have to deal with this OAuth nonsense
# again (i hope)
